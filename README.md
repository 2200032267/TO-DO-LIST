The To-Do List project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to manage tasks effectively. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

Adding Tasks: Users can input new tasks into the text input field and press "Enter" to add them to the list. The entered tasks are dynamically added to the list.
Removing Tasks: Each task has a remove button associated with it. Clicking on the remove button removes the corresponding task from the list.
Task Completion Status: Tasks are visually differentiated based on their completion status. Completed tasks are represented with one color, indicating they are done, while incomplete tasks are represented with another color, indicating they are pending.
Marking Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking on them. This action toggles the completion status of the task and updates its visual representation accordingly.
The project provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks, allowing users to easily add, remove, and track the completion status of their to-do items. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, making it a practical example for learning web development skills.The To-Do List project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to manage tasks effectively.
